      <p>
        Love me partly, leave me tonight<br>
        Say, "Don't fall in pieces, " I might<br>
        Just for the fun of it<br>
        Let my mind just run with it tonight
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Since the Stone Age, I've been stoned in<br>
        Living lonely on my own<br>
        Then she came along, made me believe<br>
        Made me believe, I wouldn't leave her<br>
        I'm finished wasting my time<br>
        I'm living blurred like those lines<br>
        I fill my cup to forget her<br>
        Known it from the get-up, this is my demise<br>
        My demise is what's holding me<br>
        Grabbed a hold and took control of me in my mind
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Love me partly, leave me tonight<br>
        Say, "Don't fall in pieces, " I might<br>
        Just for the fun of it<br>
        Let my mind just run with it tonight
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Where did you wanna go?<br>
        Where did you stay last night?<br>
        Save my mind, save my time<br>
        Yeah, I know I've been holding on to something<br>
        For so long, mm, with no eyes<br>
        Yeah, I've been blind, I've been blind<br>
        I fill my cup to forget her<br>
        I've known it from the get-up, this is my demise
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Love me partly, leave me tonight<br>

        So when I wake up today<br>
        Hoping I don't feel the same<br>
        As I did last night, shit-faced, not knowing which way<br>
        Is up or down, or sideways, I'm frowning anyway
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Please give me one more day of happiness<br>
        I need it, I need it<br>
        Please give me one more day of happiness<br>
        I need it, I need it<br>
        Please give me one more day<br>
        I need it, I need it
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Wake up and bake up again<br>
        Fight and hope we make up again<br>
        Know when something's wrong, but something inside tells me it's all okay<br>
        Even if it's strange, it's our love
      </p>

        Please give me one more day of happiness<br>

        When I think of things lost, think I fell off<br>
        Took my foot off the pedal<br>
        Think it's so suss, ain't one to make a fuss<br>
        I don't need any medals
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Please give me one more day of happiness<br>
        I need it, I need it<br>
        Please give me one more day of happiness<br>
        I need it, I need it<br>
        Please give me one more day

        From this place, I'm runnin' from, I hope I kept my grace<br>
        From this place, I'm runnin' from, I hope I kept my grace<br>
        From this place, I'm runnin' from, I know I can't escape<br>

      One, two, three, go<br>
      Let me mean it what I say, I been feeling<br>
      Yeah, and dreaming my life away<br>
      Just need to level with sky<br>
      It seems to live on my mind<br>
      I been dreaming, feeling this way<br>
      I been needing something else<br>
      I know what it is when I see it<br>
      Can't hold on anymore to this feeling<br>
      With no senses, ain't no sentence making sense of us<br>
      Did I mention life's intention<br>
      Never steered me the right way?

      Oh, I've been falling<br>
      I been dreaming, feeling this way<br>

      Say I been falling in love and in the morning<br>
      Then I feel nothing again<br>
      Please don't let me forget falling in love it's all good<br>
      And in the morning then you call me again<br>
      Don't call me again, don't call again<br>
      When you faded, no need to call me again

    <p>
      I've been lied to all my life<br>
      I've been lied to all my life<br>
      In those flashing lights, you most felt alive<br>
      Am I fallin' through those cracks again?<br>
      Feels like I've been lied to all my life
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You got me burnin' for your touch<br>
      You got me burnin' for your love<br>
      I can't live without you, can't breathe without you<br>
      No need to doubt yourself<br>
      I'm infatuated with the things you do<br>
      You do me right<br>
      You stay by my side<br>
      Through thick and thin, this sentiment don't exist without you<br>
      You make me feel alive

    <p>
      I don't know what's right or wrong<br>
      But I feel like I know<br>
      I don't know if I can fight it<br>
      'Cause I've been lost alone<br>
      You do me right<br>
      You stay by my side<br>

  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>
      I'm gonna play bad, I'm gonna play hard<br>
      I can't tell the difference between my sleeve and my heart<br>
      Hey, hey, hey<br>
      I got it in the bag, I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      But I can't tell the difference<br>
      Between my sleeve and my heart
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I see the way that my glass stays half full<br>
      Just look away 'til the lenses focus<br>
      I ain't concerned with all that hocus-pocus<br>
      You can save a wand for them and just show them<br>
      I say, "Wingardium, " that means I'm levitatin'<br>
      I'm feelin' things when this is gone, still lives within my statement<br>
      All in the lift, I'm reachin' what will it take you to see me?<br>
      Only can tell the difference between my heart and my sleeve
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I got it in the bag, I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      But I can't tell the difference<br>
      Between my sleeve and my heart
    </p>
  
    <p>
      And if it ain't in this place, I'm in my body<br>
      What would it take for you to see?<br>
      I'll just steer a wave and rise above it<br>
      While I float in this fuchsia sea<br>
      'Cause I ain't slept for days, my eyes are burnin'<br>
      And what would it take for you to see?<br>
      I'll just steer a wave, rise above it<br>
      In this fuchsia sea
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I got it in the bag, I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      I can't tell you nothin' different<br>
      I got it in the bag<br>
      Ooh<br>
      Ooh<br>

      She got, she got, she got<br>
      Her own reasons<br>
      For talking to me<br>

      Give a fuck<br>
      About what I need<br>
      And I can't tell you why<br>
      Because my brain can't equate it<br>
      Tell me your lies<br>
      Because I just can't face it

      So my silence won't<br>
      Be mistaken for peace<br>
      Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?

      Could it be that it's a lesson<br>
      That I never had to learn?<br>
      I looked at it like a blessing<br>

      I don't know why<br>
      I don't know why

      All I wanted was a cup of coffee<br>
      I got something else, or so it seems<br>
      Concrete kisses on my face and forehead<br>
      From where I fell last night on the street<br>
      When I fell hard<br>
      All these scars on my skin<br>
      Where you left marks<br>
      When I fell hard<br>
      All these scars on my skin<br>
      Where you left marks

      This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real<br>
      I'm finding my way on the highway this year<br>
      Got a big old cup of shit, told me to drink it<br>
      Middle finger to what you believe<br>
      Beginnings have a habit of ending<br>
      Purgatory, I'm stuck here in-between, mm<br>
      This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real<br>
      I'm finding my way on the highway this year

    <p>
      Why does this pain feel so good?<br>
      Pumping my brain like drunk blood<br>
      Feeling this way, there's no such thing as happy endings<br>
      See on my face, my heart changed<br>
      Loving this place I've created<br>
      Realized that I'm too good for games we've been playing<br>
      This might not sound right, but it's alright, it's real<br>
      I'm finding my way on the highway this year

      I've been drinking absinthe, I just did the math<br>

      Runnin' 'round this board game, you can know your own name<br>
      I won't give it up
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Am I crazy? Am I foolish?<br>
      Am I stupid for playing these games with you?<br>
      If I told you I loved you, would you say that it's f- up?<br>
      If I told you they're flying, would you say that you looked up?<br>
      Don't take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am<br>

      I've been reading old - and I can't make sense of it<br>

      Take me as I am, I'm tired of dancin'<br>

    <p>
      No two people are the same<br>
      Stand beside you, but just far enough away<br>
      Last night we were drinking<br>
      Tried to think away the pain<br>
      Made that age-old mistake<br>
      Tried to disconnect my body<br>
      From my soul, from my soul<br>
      See, I feel alright already on my own<br>
      Can you let me be<br>
      Intoxicated on my own?<br>
      Do I need to answer<br>
      Or right my wrongs?<br>
      Am I home if I don't know this place?<br>
      And I've been feeling alienated<br>
      On my spaceship alone<br>
      Say goodbye to the past<br>
      Leave it all with a laugh<br>
      'Cause you always was right all along
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Know my reasons for the pain<br>
      But if you brought it in front of me<br>
      I know I'd do it all again<br>
      Call them beer can gains<br>
      I know from all the years<br>
      That my feelings never change<br>
      Can you let me be<br>
      Intoxicated on my own?<br>
      Do I need to answer<br>

      'Cause you always was right all along
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Did the winds make the noise of change?<br>
      Can the wings on your skin help you fly away?<br>
      'Cause it's always raining<br>
      And the clouds always grey when you're away<br>
      Yeah, I've been feeling alienated<br>
      On my spaceship alone<br>
      Say goodbye to the past (ayy, ayy)<br>
      Leave it all with a laugh<br>
      'Cause you always was right all along<br>
      All along<br>
